  abstract = {Brain encoding and decoding via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are two important aspects of visual perception neuroscience. Although previous researchers have made signiﬁcant advances in brain encoding and decoding models, existing methods still require improvement using advanced machine learning techniques. For example, traditional methods usually build the encoding and decoding models separately, and are prone to overﬁtting on a small dataset. In fact, effectively unifying the encoding and decoding procedures may allow for more accurate predictions. In this paper, we ﬁrst review the existing encoding and decoding methods and discuss the potential advantages of a ‘‘bidirectional” modeling strategy. Next, we show that there are correspondences between deep neural networks and human visual streams in terms of the architecture and computational rules. Furthermore, deep generative models (e.g., variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs)) have produced promising results in studies on brain encoding and decoding. Finally, we propose that the dual learning method, which was originally designed for machine translation tasks, could help to improve the performance of encoding and decoding models by leveraging large-scale unpaired data.},

  abstract  = {The development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.},

Leading authorities describe the most important theoretical approaches in personality and review the state of the science in five broad content areas: biological bases; development; self and social processes; cognitive and motivational processes; and emotion, adjustment, and health. Within each area, chapters present innovative ideas, findings, research designs, and measurement approaches. Areas of integration and consensus are discussed, as are key questions and controversies still facing the field.},
