  abstract = {There is a widespread interest in applying pattern recognition methods to anatomical neuroimaging data, but so far, there has been relatively little investigation into how best to derive image features in order to make the most accurate predictions. In this work, a Gaussian Process machine learning approach was used for predicting age, gender and body mass index (BMI) of subjects in the IXI dataset, as well as age, gender and diagnostic status using the ABIDE and COBRE datasets. MRI data were segmented and aligned using SPM12, and a variety of feature representations were derived from this preprocessing. We compared classification and regression accuracy using the different sorts of features, and with various degrees of spatial smoothing. Results suggested that feature sets that did not ignore the implicit background tissue class, tended to result in better overall performance, whereas some of the most commonly used feature sets performed relatively poorly.},

  abstract  = {We examined whether it is possible to identify individual subjects on the basis of brain anatomical features. For this, we analyzed a dataset comprising 191 subjects who were scanned three times over a period of two years. Based on FreeSurfer routines, we generated three datasets covering 148 anatomical regions (cortical thickness, area, volume). These three datasets were also combined to a dataset containing all of these three measures. In addition, we used a dataset comprising 11 composite anatomical measures for which we used larger brain regions (11LBR). These datasets were subjected to a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and a weighted K-nearest neighbors approach (WKNN) to identify single subjects. For this, we randomly chose a data subset (training set) with which we calculated the individual identification. The obtained results were applied to the remaining sample (test data). In general, we obtained excellent identification results (reasonably good results were obtained for 11LBR using WKNN). Using different data manipulation techniques (adding white Gaussian noise to the test data and changing sample sizes) still revealed very good identification results, particularly for the LDA technique. Interestingly, using the small 11LBR dataset also revealed very good results indicating that the human brain is highly individual.},

  abstract = {Brain encoding and decoding via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are two important aspects of visual perception neuroscience. Although previous researchers have made signiﬁcant advances in brain encoding and decoding models, existing methods still require improvement using advanced machine learning techniques. For example, traditional methods usually build the encoding and decoding models separately, and are prone to overﬁtting on a small dataset. In fact, effectively unifying the encoding and decoding procedures may allow for more accurate predictions. In this paper, we ﬁrst review the existing encoding and decoding methods and discuss the potential advantages of a ‘‘bidirectional” modeling strategy. Next, we show that there are correspondences between deep neural networks and human visual streams in terms of the architecture and computational rules. Furthermore, deep generative models (e.g., variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs)) have produced promising results in studies on brain encoding and decoding. Finally, we propose that the dual learning method, which was originally designed for machine translation tasks, could help to improve the performance of encoding and decoding models by leveraging large-scale unpaired data.},

  abstract  = {The development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.},

The three-dimensional, Fourier-transformed acquisitions require magnetization-prepared 180 degrees radio-frequency pulses and rapid gradient-echo (MP RAGE) sampling. The resulting T1-weighted images were compared with T1-weighted spin-echo (SE) images; both were obtained after paramagnetic contrast material was administered to 33 patients with known or suspected focal brain lesions. Image quality and contrast between gray and white matter were superior with the MP RAGE sequence compared with the T1-weighted SE sequence. The time for obtaining contiguous thin-section (1.3-2.5-mm) images was also comparable, with readily acquired multiplanar reformations obviating additional images. MP RAGE imaging depicted more focal lesions than did T1-weighted SE imaging and matched the number seen with T2-weighted SE imaging. Demonstration of paramagnetic contrast enhancement of lesions was comparable in most cases; however, three lesions showed greater enhancement on T1-weighted SE images and two others were seen only on the T1-weighted SE images. Thus, the MP RAGE sequence may provide an alternative to T1-weighted SE imaging.},

HCP-D is enrolling 1300+ healthy children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 5–21), and HCP-A is enrolling 1200+ healthy adults (ages 36–100+), with each study collecting longitudinal data in a subset of individuals at particular age ranges. The imaging protocols of the HCP-D and HCP-A studies are very similar, differing primarily in the selection of different task-fMRI paradigms. We strove to harmonize the imaging protocol to the greatest extent feasible with the completed HCP-YA (1200+ participants, aged 22–35), but some imaging-related changes were motivated or necessitated by hardware changes, the need to reduce the total amount of scanning per participant, and/or the additional challenges of working with young and elderly populations. Here, we provide an overview of the common HCP-D/A imaging protocol including data and rationales for protocol decisions and changes relative to HCP-YA. The result will be a large, rich, multi-modal, and freely available set of consistently acquired data for use by the scientific community to investigate and define normative developmental and aging related changes in the healthy human brain.},

The combination of ABIDE I and ABIDE II provides investigators with 2156 unique cross-sectional datasets allowing selection of samples for discovery and/or replication. This sample size can also facilitate the identification of neurobiological subgroups, as well as preliminary examinations of sex differences in ASD.

  abstract = {Tensor-based morphometry (TBM) creates three-dimensional maps of disease-related differences in brain structure, based on nonlinearly registering brain MRI scans to a common image template. Using two different TBM designs (averaging individual differences versus aligning group average templates), we compared the anatomical distribution of brain atrophy in 40 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 40 healthy elderly controls, and 40 individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a condition conferring increased risk for AD. We created an unbiased geometrical average image template for each of the three groups, which were matched for sex and age (mean age: 76.1 years+/-7.7 SD). We warped each individual brain image (N=120) to the control group average template to create Jacobian maps, which show the local expansion or compression factor at each point in the image, reflecting individual volumetric differences. Statistical maps of group differences revealed widespread medial temporal and limbic atrophy in AD, with a lesser, more restricted distribution in MCI. Atrophy and CSF space expansion both correlated strongly with Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Using cumulative p-value plots, we investigated how detection sensitivity was influenced by the sample size, the choice of search region (whole brain, temporal lobe, hippocampus), the initial linear registration method (9- versus 12-parameter), and the type of TBM design. In the future, TBM may help to (1) identify factors that resist or accelerate the disease process, and (2) measure disease burden in treatment trials.},
