# Introduction

Multi-center studies and data aggregation initiatives have become a standard resource in the field of neuroimaging and a clear prerequisite for the long-term advancement of the field {cite}`horienHitchhikerGuideWorking2021, vanhornItTimeReprioritize2009, lairdLargeOpenDatasets2021`. The creation and utility of such datasets introduces numerous technical and methodological challenges which have become an increasingly popular topic of research, and often debate. However, even if all data is archived, preprocessed, and distributed in a completely tested, reproducible, and documented manner, working with repositories of datasets at a large scale requires compromises to be made. The variability and complexity of MRI acquisition and preprocessing predetermines highly heterogeneous results {cite}`borghiDataManagementSharing2018, gronenschildEffectsFreeSurferVersion2012 , botvinik-nezerVariabilityAnalysisSingle2020`, and it is practically impossible to standardize acquisition protocols and preprocessing procedures across all research centers and application domains. Routine procedures, such as providing access to raw data, modifying analysis configurations and integrating new workflows, all become significantly more difficult to support with every increase in scale.

Assuming variation in the many procedures and configurations applied to raw research data is inherent (and to an extent desirable), it is imperative we continuously refine our understanding of the implications of each decision that is made and the significance of various steps and parameters used in the preparation and distribution of our data. This study focuses on {{sMRI}} preprocessing, which is the common denominator of the great majority of MRI-based neuroimaging research, and more specifically on the reliability of cross-sectional anatomical statistics calculated with *FreeSurfer*'s surface reconstruction pipeline {cite}`fischlFreeSurfer2012` using a subset of available execution configurations. *FreeSurfer* is a popular and freely available open source neuroimaging toolkit for processing, analyzing, and visualizing human brain {{MR}} images (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). It has previously been demonstrated that *FreeSurfer* successfully captures subtle morphological changes in brain structure {cite}`lehmannAtrophyPatternsAlzheimer2010, salatRegionalWhiteMatter2009`, and a number of studies have already pioneered the evaluation of variation originating from differences in *FreeSurfer* versions, operating system, scan session, head-tilt, inter-scan interval, acquisition sequence, and preprocessing stream (cross-sectional or longitudinal) {cite}`hedgesReliabilityStructuralMRI2022, gronenschildEffectsFreeSurferVersion2012, knussmannTestretestReliabilityFreeSurferderived2022, hanReliabilityMRIderivedMeasurements2006a, dickersonDetectionCorticalThickness2008, jovicichMRIderivedMeasurementsHuman2009`. Such explorations are key for the sustainability of multi-site collaborations and research leveraging data from heterogeneous sources in the field in general.

Another persepective on *FreeSurfer*-derived anatomical statistics within versus between-participants deals with identification and classification. Identification refers to the ability to "recognize" an individual from a particular sample, i.e. the model has the same number of target classes as the number of participants it has been trained on, and new samples are associated by the model to the most likely participant. Classification, on the other hand, provides some grouping or categorization in which the number of classes is smaller than the number of subjects, e.g. by age group, sex, dominant hand, etc. {cite}`valizadehIdentificationIndividualSubjects2018`. This chapter will provide a summary of the results of two types of classification tasks: (a) distinguishing between pairs of {{MPRAGE}} scans belonging to the same subject versus pairs belonging to different subjects, and (b) predicting a subset of basic participant attributes, namely sex, age, and {{BMI}}. Each task will be trained on an identical set of scans, but using anatomical statistics generated by different *FreeSurfer* execution configurations.

The purpose of this study is to expand on previous studies and determine the within-subject reproducibility of *FreeSurfer*-derived anatomical statistics by running a subset of the available execution configurations over a large dataset originating from a single scanner using a consistent acquisition protocol and analyzed on a single server with a particular version of *FreeSurfer*. The importance of exploring these differences between individually processed scans is twofold; first, it is meant to help inform future data harmonization endeavors, and second, to provide a heuristic for identifying subjects across anonymized and preprocessed datasets. In addition, the relationship between within-subject variability and the performance of models for the prediction of sex, age, and {{BMI}} will be evaluated, with the purpose of testing whether the set of parameters which minimizes within-subject differences does, in fact, also benefits modeling efforts.
