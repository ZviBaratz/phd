## Public Large-scale Neuroimaging Datasets

Centralized data collection and distribution efforts are key to the advancement of neuroscientific research. Larger publicly available samples enable the detection and study of phenomena with smaller effect sizes more rapidly, by more people, and with more confidence {cite}`smithStatisticalChallengesBig2018, lairdLargeOpenDatasets2021, madanScanOnceAnalyse2021`. Data sharing not only enhances the reporoducibility of findings, but also reduces time and costs for new research in the field {cite}`marHowProducePersonality2013a, poldrackMakingBigData2014, madanAdvancesStudyingBrain2017, milhamAssessmentImpactShared2018`. In recent years, such public datsets have become more numerous and increasingly accessible. The following table, taken from a practical guide to end-users (researchers interested in using public neuroimaging datasets) published in *Nature Human Behaviour* (https://www.nature.com/nathumbehav/) {cite}`horienHitchhikerGuideWorking2021`, offers a summary of currently available datasets, including sample size, modalities, processing stages, and access policy:

**Taken from "A hitchhiker’s guide to working with large, open-source neuroimaging datasets" {cite}`horienHitchhikerGuideWorking2021`.**<br />**a**, For each dataset listed in the leftmost column, sample size is indicated, along with the type of data included (‘Data modalities’). ‘Data level’ refers to the level of preprocessing: white circle, raw data; grey circle, some level of preprocessed data; black, processed data (for example, statistical maps, connectivity matrices, etc.). **b**, For each open repository (i.e., a collection of open datasets) listed in the leftmost column, an estimate of the number of open datasets is listed. Datasets of particular interest are highlighted (‘Featured large datasets’). Sample sizes and the number of open datasets are current as of October 2020. Users are encouraged to visit the website associated with each dataset before use, as sample sizes, access conditions, etc. may change.
